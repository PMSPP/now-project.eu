We've got recently a couple of orders of this machine so we will produce 5 in total. The machine in it self got initially build by taller https://davehakkens.nl/preciousplastic/esferica-sunglasses/ and it has more benefits over the standard injection machine designed by Dave Hakkens : more rigid & power.

The components however remain almost the same :

3 heatbands (china brand)
1 PID controller
1 SSR
control enclosure
1 car jack to lift the bottom plate
1 rack & spur gear (Module 3) : 30 mm x 30 mm x 500 mm
We will update the pictures soon !
